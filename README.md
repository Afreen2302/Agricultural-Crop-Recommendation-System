Abstractâ€” This research project delves into the realm of agriculture, aiming to optimize crop selection based on a myriad of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil pH, and levels of nitrogen and potassium. By harnessing the power of data analysis and machine learning algorithms, this study contributes to the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices, aligning closely with Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12) which underscores the importance of responsible consumption and production. The core focus lies in facilitating data-driven decision-making processes, where comprehensive analysis of diverse parameters enables informed choices regarding crop cultivation. Leveraging the robustness of the Random Forest predictor, a machine learning algorithm renowned for its accuracy and reliability, this research endeavors to develop a Crop Recommendation System capable of offering tailored suggestions with high precision. Through meticulous examination of varied environmental metrics and the implementation of advanced computational techniques, this project not only aims to enhance crop yield and agricultural efficiency but also strives towards fostering a more sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to farming practices.
