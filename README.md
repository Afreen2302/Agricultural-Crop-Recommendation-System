### Project Overview
Agricultural Crop Recommendation System uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most suitable crop to grow in a particular field based on input parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

### Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize environmental and soil parameters.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Machine learning model to recommend the best crop to plant.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly web interface for farmers to input parameters and get recommendations.
